\title{A function to clean data accessed from the NIOZ WATLAS server.}
\usage{
wat_clean_data(
  data,
  moving_window = 3,
  nbs_min = 0,
  sd_threshold = 5e+05,
  filter_speed = TRUE,
  speed_cutoff = 150
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe object returned by getData.
Must contain the columns "X", "Y", "SD", "NBS", "TAG", "TIME";
these are the X coordinate, Y coordinate, standard deviation in measurement,
number of ATLAS towers that received the signal, the tag number, and
the numeric time, in milliseconds from 1970-01-01.}

\item{moving_window}{The size of the moving window for the running
median calculation.}

\item{nbs_min}{The minimum number of base stations (ATLAS towers) that
received tag signal.}

\item{sd_threshold}{A threshold value above which rows are removed.}

\item{filter_speed}{Logical specifiying whether to use the speed filter
or not.}

\item{speed_cutoff}{The maximum speed in kilometres per hour allowed in the
raw data. Points with straight line displacement speeds calculated as above
this are removed.}
}
\value{
A datatable class object (extends data.frame) which has the
additional columns posID and ts, which is TIME converted to human
readable POSIXct format.
