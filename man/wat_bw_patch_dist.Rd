\usage{
wat_bw_patch_dist(
  data,
  x1 = "x_end",
  x2 = "x_start",
  y1 = "y_end",
  y2 = "y_start"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe of or extending the class data.frame.
This must contain two pairs of coordinates, the start and end X and Y
coordinates of a feature.}

\item{x1}{The first X coordinate or longitude; for inter-patch distances,
this is the last coordinate (X_end) of a patch n0.}

\item{x2}{The second X coordinate; for inter-patch distances, this is the
first coordinate (X_start) of a subsequent patch n1.}

\item{y1}{The first Y coordinate or latitude; for inter-patch distances,
this is the last coordinate (Y_end) of a patch n0.}

\item{y2}{The second Y coordinate; for inter-patch distances, this is the
first coordinate (Y_start) of a subsequent patch n1.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of the length of the number of patches, or rows in
the input dataframe. If the input dataframe has only a single row, the
vector has a length of one, and its only element is 0. In all other cases,
the vector has as its elements \code{NA}, followed by n-1 distances, where
n is the number of rows.
