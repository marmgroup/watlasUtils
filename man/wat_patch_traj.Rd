\usage{
wat_patch_traj(df, x1 = "x_end", x2 = "x_start", y1 = "y_end", y2 = "y_start")
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe with at least 2 pairs of coordinate columns,
such as X_end Y_end, X_start, Y_start.}

\item{x1}{Coordinate column for the beginning X coordinate of the linestring;
this should be the last X coordinate of each patch if inter-patch
linestrings are to be constructed. It is possible to use the X_start
coordinate, but this will lead to issues and nonsensical output at
this point.}

\item{x2}{Coordinate column for the end X coordinate of the linestring;
this should be the first X coordinate of each patch if inter-patch
linestrings are to be constructed.}

\item{y1}{Coordinate column for the beginning Y coordinate of the
linestring; this should be the last Y coordinate of each patch if inter-patch
 linestrings are to be constructed. It is possible to use the X_start
 coordinate, but this will lead to issues and nonsensical output at
 this point.}

\item{y2}{Coordinate column for the end Y coordinate of the linestring; this
should be the first Y coordinate of each patch if inter-patch linestrngs are
to be constructed.}
}
\value{
An \code{sf MULTILINESTRING} object representing the linear path
between N patches, starting at the end point of the first patch, and ending
at the first point of the Nth patch.
