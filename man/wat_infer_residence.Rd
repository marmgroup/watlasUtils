\title{Infer residence patches from gaps in the canonical data.}
\usage{
wat_infer_residence(data, inf_patch_time_diff = 30, inf_patch_spat_diff = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe of recurse analysis, or must include, in addition
to x, y and time columns, a residence time column named resTime, id, and
tide_number, a tidaltime column named tidaltime.}

\item{inf_patch_time_diff}{A numeric duration in minutes, of the minimum
time difference between two points, above which, it is assumed worthwhile to
examine whether there is a missing residence patch to be inferred.}

\item{inf_patch_spat_diff}{A numeric distance in metres, of the maximum
spatial distance between two points, below which it may be assumed few
extreme movements took place between them.}
}
\value{
A data.frame extension object. This dataframe has additional inferred
 points, indicated by the additional column for empirical fixes ('real')
 or 'inferred'.
